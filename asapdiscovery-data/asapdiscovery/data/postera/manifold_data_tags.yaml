# ABOUT: yaml file describing the relationship between outputs and available methods
# as well as the relationship between available biochemical targets and organisms
#
# organisms, targets, and outputs are combined to form the full set of tags.
# with the form:
#
# <output>_<tool>_<unit?>_<organism>_<target>
#
# where <unit?> is only included if the output has a unit.
#
# for example:
#  - Docking_Score_POSIT_sars2_Mpro
#  - ML_Score_GAT_pIC50_sars2_Mac1
#  - MD_Pose_mers_Mpro
#  - MD_Interactions_mers_Mpro
#  - FECs_Affinity_pIC50_sars2_Mac1
#  ...
#
# are all valid tags.
#
# These are combined with the static identifiers to form the full set of tags.

# The complete set is generated programatically at import time in `manifold_data_validation.py`

# organisms and targets
virus:
  SARS-CoV-2:
    - Mpro
    - Mac1
  MERS-CoV:
    - Mpro

# requires both units and tools specified even if empty for clarity.
