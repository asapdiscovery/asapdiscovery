    "\n",
    "`ASAP-Alchemy` provides a set of automated workflows which when combined create and end-to-end pipeline enabling the routine running of state-of-the-art alchemical free energy calculations at (Alchemi)scale! In this tutorial we cover configuring and executing each of the workflows via the python API, but note `ASAP-Alchemy` also provides a CLI which can be used to execute any of the workflows and accepts custom configuration files providing the same amount of flexibility as the API but with easier execution! We also have tried and tested defaults in all of our workflows which are used in production so feel free to skip configuring each workflow unless you really need the extra flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General design\n",
    "Each of the workflows in `ASAP-Alchemy` are designed following the same factory pattern which allows them to have a similar API which should make them all feel familiar. Each workflow then begins as a resuable configuration object which defines the runtime options of that pipeline which can then be applied to sets of molecules.\n",

    "- **Constrained Pose Generation**: Generate initial poses for the lignads while constraining the ligand to match the crystal structure reference conformation.\n",

    "Before using the predictions in production it is common to benchmark the system under study to asses its suitability for free energy calculations, this normally involves curating a set of similar ligands which have reliable experimental measures of affinity and estimating their affinity using the production protocol. To help with debugging these benchmarks we have created some tools to produce interactive graphs to make it easier to identify outliers. Here we will generate interactive equivalents of the cinnabar graphs using `ASAP-Alchemy`. First, we use a utility function which extracts the absolute and relative predictions from the cinnabar `FEMap` and inserts experimental data extracted from a formatted csv file.
