    "# Running alchemical free energy calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "`ASAP-Alchemy` provides a set of automated workflows which when combined create and end-to-end pipeline enabling the routine running of state-of-the-art alchemical free energy calculations at (Alchemi)scale! In this tutorial we cover configuring and executing each of the workflows via the python API, but note `ASAP-Alchemy` also provides a CLI which can be used to execute any of the workflows and accepts custom configuration files providing the same amount of flexibility as the API but with easier execution! We also have tried and tested defaults in all of our workflows which are used in production so feel free to skip configuring each workflow unless you really need the extra flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General design\n",
    "Each of the workflows in `ASAP-Alchemy` are designed following the same factory pattern which allows them to have a similar API which should make them all feel familiar. Each workflow then begins as a resuable configuration object which defines the runtime options of that pipeline which can then be applied to sets of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ASAP-Alchemy Prep\n",
    "The first stage in the workflow is called `prep` and has two main jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Enumeration**: Enumerate the tautomers, protomers and stereoisomers of the input ligands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constrained Pose Generation**: Generate initial poses for the lignads while constraining the ligand to match the crystal structure reference conformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now walk through the process building a standard `AlchemyPrepWorkflow` and assigning the required component parts:"

One option is to use tools like OpenEye to try and predict the most reasonable form of a molecule at the experimental pH in question, another is to enumerate all possible forms and and use a state pentalty correction scheme based on the predicted pKa of each state.

At ASAP we use Alchemiscale exclusively allowing us to manage thousands of simultaneous calculations across many networks across many supercomputers, however it is very easy to also execute the calculations locally. We have an interface to simply convert the network to the OpenFE `AlchemicalNetwork` object and use either the CLI or API provided by OpenFE to execute the tasks see the [tutorials](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/stable/tutorials/index.html) for more information:"

    "Once we have a successful set of transformations we can estimate the absolute binding affinity of our ligands by combining the relative measures via the maximum likelihood estimator method implemented in cinnabar, a best practices method for reporting the results of free energy calculations. ASAP-Alchemy has an interface to Cinnabar to make it easy to turn the simulation results into useful information for the med chem team. For this example we will use the TYK2 network which has been curated as part of the [protein-ligand benchmark](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/protein-ligand-benchmark) dataset, we have the results of a subsection of this network in our testing suite."

    "Before using the predictions in production it is common to benchmark the system under study to asses its suitability for free energy calculations, this normally involves curating a set of similar ligands which have reliable experimental measures of affinity and estimating their affinity using the production protocol. To help with debugging these benchmarks we have created some tools to produce interactive graphs to make it easier to identify outliers. Here we will generate interactive equivalents of the cinnabar graphs using `ASAP-Alchemy`. First, we use a utility function which extracts the absolute and relative predictions from the cinnabar `FEMap` and inserts experimental data extracted from a formatted csv file. Note that the absolute predictions are also automatically shifted to match the experimental range of binding affinity values:"
