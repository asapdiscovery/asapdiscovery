    "# Running alchemical free energy calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "`ASAP-Alchemy` provides a set of automated workflows which when combined create and end-to-end pipeline enabling the routine running of state-of-the-art alchemical free energy calculations at (Alchemi)scale! In this tutorial we cover configuring and executing each of the workflows via the python API, but note `ASAP-Alchemy` also provides a CLI which can be used to execute any of the workflows and accepts custom configuration files providing the same amount of flexibility as the API but with easier execution! We also have tried and tested defaults in all of our workflows which are used in production so feel free to skip configuring each workflow unless you really need the extra flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General design\n",
    "Each of the workflows in `ASAP-Alchemy` are designed following the same factory pattern which allows them to have a similar API which should make them all feel familiar. Each workflow then begins as a resuable configuration object which defines the runtime options of that pipeline which can then be applied to sets of molecules.\n",

    "# ASAP-Alchemy Prep\n",
    "The first stage in the workflow is called `prep` and has two main jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Enumeration**: Enumerate the tautomers, protomers and stereoisomers of the input ligands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constrained Pose Generation**: Generate initial poses for the lignads while constraining the ligand to match the crystal structure reference conformation.\n",

    "We will now walk through the process building a standard `AlchemyPrepWorkflow` and assigning the required component parts:"

    "We are now ready to execute our alchemical network and estimate the relative binding affinity of the ligands. Currently there are two ways to do this locally with OpenFE or on distributed compute via Alchemiscale. At ASAP we use Alchemiscale exclusively allowing us to manage thousands of simultaneous calculations accross many networks acrtoss many supercomputers, however it is very easy to also execute the calculations locally. We have an interface to simply convert the network to the OpenFE `AlchemicalNetwork` object and use either the CLI or API provided by OpenFE to execute the tasks see the [tutorials](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/stable/tutorials/index.html) for more information:"
