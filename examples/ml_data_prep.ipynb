    "\n",
    "1. Using the online CDD UI, perform a search for the molecules you want to download. Ensure that all the information you want for each compound is selected in the report.\n",
    "2. Save the search and keep a note of the search's URL\n",
    "3. Use the `asapdiscovery` API to download, filter, and process your data as desired. The code for this step is shown below\n",

    "Note also that you can of course skip all the CDD-related steps if you have an alternative data source or already have your molecules in a local CSV file.\n",

    "The code below should run as is, with the exception of the `vault_id`, `search`, and `CDDTOKEN` needing to be filled in, and potentially needing to change the `id_fieldname`, `smiles_fieldname`, and `assay_name`."
