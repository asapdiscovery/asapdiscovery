    "\n",
    "1. Using the online CDD UI, perform a search for the molecules you want to download. Ensure that all the information you want for each compound is selected in the report.\n",
    "2. Save the search and keep a note of the search's URL\n",
    "3. Use the `asapdiscovery` API to download, filter, and process your data as desired. The code for this step is shown below\n",
