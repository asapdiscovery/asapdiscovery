Tutorials
=========

The following tutorials are available to help you get started with ASAP.
These are designed as an introduction to the library layer of `asapdiscovery`. 

.. note::
   Many of these functionalities are available in easy to use CLI tools. 
   See the Guide section and  CLI documentation for more information.

Docking and scoring
--------------------

This tutorial will guide you through the process of docking a small molecule to an ASAP target and scoring its interactions with physics based scorers and E3 equivariant ML models . 


Running alchemical free energy calculations
-------------------------------------------

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running alchemical free energy calculations for an ASAP target and analyzing the results.


Visualizing ASAP targets
-------------------------

This tutorial will guide you through the process of visualizing ASAP targets, including the protein structure, ligands, and mutable residues.


Working with fitness data
-------------------------

This tutorial will guide you through the process of working with fitness data for ASAP targets, including visualizing the data and scoring ligands on the basis of interactions with mutable residues.


Exploring related sequences and structures
-------------------------------------------

This tutorial will guide you through the process of exploring related sequences and structures for an ASAP target.
