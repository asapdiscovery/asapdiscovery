Future
========

The comp-chem team at ASAP is seeking to productise our workflows into individual pieces that are of use to the community on their own.

We are actively looking for collaborations in these spaces. If you are interested please raise an issue on the repo, or contact hugo.macdermott@choderlab.org or jenke.scheen@choderalab.org. 

Our current aims are:

* Spin out ASAP-
* Generalise ASAPDiscovery such that it works with arbitrary targets.
* Spin out our fitness viewer and HTML interactive visualizer into their own product
